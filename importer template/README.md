#### Written By: Emily Steed
## Purpose: 
## How to Use: 
    This Jupyter Notebook was created to allow Act East NIS users to compare versions of Importer Template Files. 
    
    Before running the code, ensure that the Macros "nis_download", "country_download", "summary_output", "additions_deletions" are updated, where "nis_download" and "country_download" are the files to be compared, "summary_output" is a .txt extension where you would like the summary comparison report to be saved, and "additions_deletions" is a .xlsx extension where you would like the additions and deletions to be saved.
