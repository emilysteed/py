## How to Use: 
    This Jupyter Notebook was created to allow Act East NIS users to compare versions of Importer Template Files. 
    
    Before running the code, ensure that the Macros "nis_download", "country_download", and "summary_output" are updated, where "nis_download" and "country_download" are the files to be compared, and "summary_output" is a file path with a .txt extension where you would like the summary comparison report to be saved.
